# GEMINI INSTRUCTIONS

## RULES:

1. Do not ask to add code on my files.
2. You can provide code but do not change the existing code on your own. I want to type it myself. This is so I would understand what happens in the code.
3. Always check for updates in the code to avoid redoing the context.

## What is this project about?

- I am creating a simple clipboard history app where users can see their previously copied text and copy it for future use. This is for those frustrations where you lost a previously copied text.

### Features planned

1. Pin / Bookmark previously copied
2. Also read copied images
3. Be able to read the text and isolate important contents like phone numbers or ID number.
4. Let the app run on the background when installed. Open using an icon on top or through a command shortcut.
